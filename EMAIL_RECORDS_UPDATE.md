# Email Records Feature Update

## Changes Made

This update refactors the "Email Records" feature to function solely as a log viewer and maintenance utility. The following changes have been implemented:

### Frontend Changes
- Removed "New Record" and "Retry Selected" buttons and all related functionality
- Improved action button placement for better visibility and usability
- Enhanced checkbox styling for better selection feedback
- Reorganized controls to have all action buttons horizontally aligned above the table
- Improved UI/UX with better visual feedback for selected rows

### Backend Changes
- Removed the POST endpoint for creating new email records
- Removed any retry logic from the backend
- Removed unused imports and references to removed functionality
- Updated documentation to reflect that new records should be added directly to the database

### Remaining Functionality
The Email Records feature now focuses on these core capabilities:
- **View**: Browse and filter existing email records
- **Edit**: Modify existing record details 
- **Delete**: Remove records individually or in bulk
- **Execute**: Apply filters and refresh the data table

## Adding New Records
New email records should now be added directly to the database using SQL scripts. This approach:
- Simplifies the UI by removing complex creation forms
- Reduces potential for user error
- Provides better control over record creation

## Database Structure
The email records table structure remains unchanged. The stored procedures for record retrieval, update, and deletion are still used.
