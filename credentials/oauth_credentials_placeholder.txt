This file is a placeholder for the OAuth credentials file.

To set up Google Drive integration, you need to:

1. Follow the instructions in gdrive_setup.md to create OAuth credentials
2. Download the OAuth credentials JSON file from Google Cloud Console
3. Save it as "oauth_credentials.json" in this directory

DO NOT commit your actual OAuth credentials to version control!
Add oauth_credentials.json to your .gitignore file.
