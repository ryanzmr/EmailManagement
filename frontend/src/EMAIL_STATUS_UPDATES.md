# Email Status Feature Updates

We've made some important updates to the email status feature to improve accuracy and user understanding:

## Status Field Name Mapping Fix

1. Fixed status name mapping between database and UI:
   - Database uses "Success" as the status name
   - Frontend UI displays this as "Sent" for better user understanding
   - Updated both StatusSummary.jsx and apiClient.js to properly map these values
   - Now all status counts correctly match the database values

## Previous Updates

1. **Email Status Tracking**: We've added a new feature to track the status of sent emails. You can now see whether an email is "Pending", "Sent", "Failed", or "Opened".
2. **UI Enhancements**: The email status indicators in the UI have been improved for better visibility and understanding.
3. **Performance Improvements**: Optimized the performance of the email sending and status tracking process.

We recommend reviewing the affected areas in your application to ensure a smooth transition to these updates.
